# module-five-challenge-api-day-schedule


## Description

A work day planner that allows a user to create a schedule. When user opens the planner, then the current day is displayed at the top of calendar. When user scrolls down, planner should show hours 9AM - 5PM. Each time block is color-coded to indicate whether it is in the past, present, or future. Past Time should be in the color grey, Present Time should be in the color Red, & Future Time should be in the color green. When user clicks into a time block, user should be able to enter an event & click the save button for that time block. Text should be saved into local storage, & when user refreshes the page, then the saved events persist. I have added a reset button to the bottom so user can clear everything, but in doing so, willclear everything from local storage. 

I was provided starter code for this project. (I have added the link to that starter code down below) I have added my own JavaScript code featuring jQuery & day.js. Bootstrap, Google Fonts, Fonts Awesome were already in file for styling.
